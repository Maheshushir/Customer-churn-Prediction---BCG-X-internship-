# Customer-churn-Prediction---BCG-X-internship-

In this project, I developed a machine learning model using Random Forest to predict customer churn based on various customer attributes and usage patterns. 
The project aims to build a model that can effectively predict customer churn, enabling businesses to proactively take measures to retain valuable customers.

 Key Steps:
 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 - Understanding the data distribution and relationships between variables.
 - Identifying patterns related to customer churn.
 - Visualizing insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn (histograms, boxplots, stacked bars).

 2. Feature Engineering:
 - Creating new features that could improve the predictive power of the model.
 - Transforming existing features (e.g., handling skewed distributions).

 3. Model Training:
 - Utilizing a Random Forest Classifier to predict churn.

 4. Model Evaluation:
 - Assessing the model's performance using various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, confusion matrix).
 - Analyzing feature importance to understand which features are most impactful.

 5. Prediction and Conclusion:
 - Generating predictions for new data.
 - Providing insights and interpretation of the model's performance and results.
